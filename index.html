        <h4>You were given an ancient African fetish-mask as a gift - but it turned out to have unexpected powers! Now, whenever you don the mask, you gain the mask's abilities and can fight crime - but beware the mysterious villains out to steal the mask back for evil purposes!
Animal Transformation - You have the ability to transform yourself into a super-powered version of any animal of equivalent size and mass, with increased strength, speed and intelligence!
and...
Shadow Control - You can manipulate and control shadows, using them to hide yourself or even as a mode of transportation (travelling from one shadow to another)!
Now, you protect Denver, Colorado from murderers, while also battling the evil plans of The Geisha!</h4>
